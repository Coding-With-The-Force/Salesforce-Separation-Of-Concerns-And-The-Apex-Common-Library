# How to Implement Separation of Concerns in Salesforce

### The Separation of Concerns Wiki  

Housed in this repo is a <a href="https://github.com/Coding-With-The-Force/Salesforce_Separation_Of_Concerns/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> that goes over how to implement Separation of Concerns in Salesforce. It explains the three layers in Salesforce that you should separate your concerns into (Service, Domain and Selector) and how to leverage the Apex Common Library to make implementing Separation of Concerns in your org considerably easier.

### The Example Code

There is also some example code showing you how an application (in this case a help desk app) in a Salesforce org might separate its concerns. If you reference the code while reading the wiki it should aide considerably in learning how to leverage the Apex Common Library to implement Separation of Concerns in your Salesforce org.

### The Example Project

Within the wiki there is an example project for you to attempt to implement on your own to get acclimated to the Apex Common Library and Separation of Concerns. There is a solution folder within the example code. Try not to spoil it for yourself... It is unlikely I will ever make another and considering it took nearly a decade for someone to make a thorough guide on how to use this library I wouldn't bet on any one else doing it anytime soon.
